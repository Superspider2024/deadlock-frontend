      About Deadlock
    </h1>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-4">
      Deadlock is just a project I thought of out of the blue because the holiday got boring and Fortnite added skibidi skins which scared me so I had to do this in three days.

      Note that the points are not based on the amount of wins but an algorithmn that decides the weight of each win. Any bug or issues on the web app please report it to my Instagram account. It is likely you encounter some due to early and rushed release.

      Don't take any of this personal, it's just a site, c'mon! If you have any issues, tell me on IG (Instagram). The username is below. Also, all this code is mine, don't copy, and the project is actually inspired by Mark Zuckerberg. Go watch the movie "The Social Network."

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-4">
      This is a solo website made by myself using just JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I deployed the frontend on Vercel and the backend on Heroku. If you have questions about the code or anything technical, text my Instagram starting with "TECHNICAL" on your first message.

      It's called Deadlock because it's called Deadlock.
