# deadlock-backend
- This is the frontend code of the deadlock site featured online. It is deployed and hosted on vercel and, yes I know the code is way worse than the backend but for the most part it works

# Documentation of versions
## Note any version starting with 0. was prior to production

## version 0.0.0
- The only version before production and the version that was first deployed into vercel for production. This version had its issues and were numerous.
- There is an ssue with the randomization algorithmn that dosen't work as intented but still achieves its goal of randomization, not pure but partially. Will fix in future versions.
- This version lacks alot of features but will soon update, one of these are the ability to easily copy the Instagram accounts and also much more interactive site.    

## version 1.0.0
- Successful deployment onto vercel and the whole project is upa nd runnning online. Need to fix the loading speeds in the deadlock page. Added google anlytics but does not work at all anyways!
